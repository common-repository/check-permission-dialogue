Integration with wordpress hooks so this can be packaged as a wordpress plugin
	wordpress hooks
		before html output
			call chk_perm_handle_getback('cookie')
			call chk_perm_load_start
		
		during html output
			call chk_perm_show_widget
			enable a shortcode for chk_perm_clear_link

		after html output should be complete
			call chk_perm_load_end($perm_keys=['cookie'])

	wordpress settings page
		widget preview display
			dropdown menu to select device-specific class in order to preview the display for different devices
			for iOS and android this will be within a container so it doesn't cover the entire page in the admin view
		allow enabling/disabling individual permissions (for now just cookie)
